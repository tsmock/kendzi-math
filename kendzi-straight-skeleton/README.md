kendzi-straight-skeleton
===========

Implementation of straight skeleton algorithm for polygons with holes. It is based on concept of tracking bisector
intersection with queue of events to process and circular list with processed events called lavs. This implementation is
highly modified concept described by Petr Felkel and Stepan Obdrzalek [1]. In compare to original this algorithm has new
kind of event and support for multiple events which appear in the same distance from edges. It is common when processing
degenerate cases caused by polygon with right angles.

Used simple events:

- edge event
- opposite edge split event
- vertex split event

Used complex events for level:

- multi edge event
- pick event
- multi split event
